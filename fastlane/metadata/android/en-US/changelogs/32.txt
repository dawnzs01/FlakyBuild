After a few months in alpha, we are very excited to launch the beta phase of the next big release of Grocy Android! A few features are still not fully implemented.
The update requires you to have grocy 3.0.x installed on your server! All versions below are no longer compatible.
You can view all changes in the app or on GitHub.
