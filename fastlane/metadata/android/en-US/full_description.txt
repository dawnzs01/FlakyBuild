<p>Grocy Android is an open-source Android client for <a href="https://grocy.info/">grocy</a> (<a href="https://github.com/grocy/grocy">source code</a>). Grocy is a self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home.</p>
<p>Grocy Android uses grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your phone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.</p>
<p><b>This app requires a running self-hosted instance of the grocy server application. It is a companion app, therefore it cannot run standalone or manage products itself! You can try and test all features using the demo option available on the login screen.</b></p>

   <li>Stock overview</li>
   <li>Shopping lists with offline support</li>
   <li>In-store shopping mode (big UI elements)</li>
   <li>Fast barcode scanning</li>
   <li>OpenFoodFacts implementation</li>
   <li>Master data editing</li>

<p><b>Contribution:</b></p>
<p>If you run into a bug or miss a feature, feel free to give feedback in the app, send us an email or <a href="https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/issues">open an issue</a> on GitHub. Like the grocy project, Grocy Android can be translated, too. Please go to our <a href="https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android">GitHub page</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>Compatibility:</b></p>
<p>Grocy Android requires at least Android 5.0 Lollipop on your device and grocy 3.0.0 on your server. It is also possible to use the grocy Add-on on a Hass.io server. Our in-app help explains how to do that.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank the developer of Grocy, Bernd Bestel, without whose great work this app would never have been possible.</p>
