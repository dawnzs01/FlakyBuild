This is a mixed Xposed+Magisk module, which is made to allow customizations that are not originally designed in AOSP (Android Open Source Project). Please read thorough below before reaching to download links

**Features:**
Currently, AOSP Mods offers customizations on different aspects of system framework and SystemUI, including:
- Status bar
- Lock screen
- Notifications
- Quick Settings panel
- Gestural Navigations
- Screen properties

**Compatibility:**
This module is designed based on AOSP source code. What does it mean? it means that it's expected to work on Roms (Firmwares) which are built based on fairly unmodified Android source code. This means, mainly, Pixel Phones (3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, 7), and any other Roms that haven't heavily modified the original Android codes. Our feedbacks show that AOSPMods is compatible with Pixel stock Roms and Pixel Experience (normal edition). The mod can also be installed on ArrowOS, Pixel Experience (Plus Edition), ProtonAOSP, LineageOS and etc with *some* broken features.

- Android 12/12.1:   [final version: v2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable (up until November 2022 firmware):   [final version: v.2.4.1](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- Android 13 stable (starting from December 2022 firmware): [starting with v.2.5](https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods/releases/tag/v2.5.0) and all the canary versions afterwards
- Android 13 beta QPR2: Not compatible until source code is out
   

**Prerequisites:**
- Compatible ROM (see above)
- Device Rooted with Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version preferred)


**How to install:**
- Download the stable magisk module according to your firmware as mentioned above 
- Install in magisk
- Reboot (no bootloops are expected)
- Open AOSPMods app and apply changes

**Variants:**  
Apart from modification on system elements, AOSPMods also includes a number of system overlays to modify fonts, system icons and colors.
However, for those who are not interested on such overlays, we have added an Xposed-only package which, as the name says, only includes the system modification, without such system overlays.

<ins>Xposed Package:</ins> Includes only Xposed-based modification and has a rather smaller file-size. This is the one that module developers also use
<ins>Full Package:</ins> Includes everything present in Xposed package, plus additional system overlay options.

You can choose either package, and install the chosen one on your device  
  
  
The module is also released in 2 flavors with different download and update procedures.
- Stable release:  
Manual Install/Update: through repository's Github release page (link below) AND through in-app updater  
Automated updates: through magisk manager, or through in-app updater  
- Canary release:  
Manual Install/Update: only through repository's Actions page  
Automated install/updates: only through in-app updater - updates will NOT appear in release section, and will NOT count against the module's download count  

*No matter which flavor you're on, you can always switch to the other one with in-app updater
